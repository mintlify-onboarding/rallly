## FAQ

### How long does Rallly keep a poll? When will my poll be deleted?

Polls are deleted if all the date options are in the past and no one has accessed the poll for over 30 days.

Demo polls are deleted after 1 day.

### How do I hide participants from each other?

This is not currently supported but will be made possible in a future update.

### How do I limit the number of participants for each option?

This is not currently supported but will be made possible in a future update.

### How do I find a poll I created?

When you create a poll the link to the **admin page** is emailed to you. Use the link inside the email to get back to your poll.

Alternatively, you can [log in](https://rallly.co/login) with the same email address you used to create the poll and go to the [profile page](https://rallly.co/profile) were you can see a list of all the polls you created.

### What times will my participants see if they are in different timezones?

When you create a poll with timed options, Rallly will assume that the times are specific to your current location. When participants view your poll they will see times adjusted to their time zone. This works well if:

* participants are in different time zones and the meeting is being held remotely

* all participants are in the same time zone

### What if my participants are in different time zones but the event is in a specific location?

You can choose **Ignore time zone** when specifying options to make sure everyone sees the same times. If you forget to do that when you create the poll you can always change it later by going to **Manage > Edit Options** on your poll.

### How do I export my results to Excel?

From your **admin page,** click on **Manage** **\> Export to CSV**. You can open CSV files in [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) or [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/excel).
