When you create a poll, you will receive two links via email. One of those links is for the admin page where you can make changes to your poll.

The buttons at the top of the page are only visible on the admin page

Alternatively, if you log in with the same email address you used to create the poll, you can access the admin page of any poll you created through the [profile page](https://rallly.co/profile).
